# concurrent_bst
Modfied FEAST implementation

## To Run the Code in Command Line:
* First type "rustc ConcurrentBST.rs"
* Then type "./ConcurrentBST"

## Notes
This is our failed Rust Implementation. We have two files, ConcurrentBST.rs is where our rust implementation would be and try.rs which is the testing area. In try.rs is where we  tested the ideas of how to implement the FEAST algorithm before we imputed it into ConcurrentBST.rs.
